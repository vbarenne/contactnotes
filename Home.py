# ### How It Works

# 1. **Upload**: With ClientNotes.ai, relationship managers can capture their notes via voice recording. A transcription is then generated using the Global Innovation team's voice-to-text model, Joice. 

# 2. **Validate**: Improve quality of the data through validation, ensuring that the all best practices have been followed based on different client interaction situations. 

# 3. **Analytics**: Leverage of the content of the contact notes to help RMs better advise their clients. In particular, by providing action items for RMs and content/products to recommend to clients. 

# 4. **Search**: Enable RMs to quickly find the information they are looking for from contact notes. This could potentially go beyond a simple search engine and be a chatbot.
