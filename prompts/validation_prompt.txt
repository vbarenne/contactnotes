Relationship managers working at a wealth management firm in Switzerland need to write down a 
contact note after any kind of client contact. The note is there so there is a trace of all client
discussions. This is both done for compliance purposes and to better advise clients by remembering 
the things talked about during the encounter. In general, the best practice is that the content of
the note should be able to answer some questions. Can you check for the following list of question whether the 
answer can be found in the contact note? Return a dictionary containing where the keys are the questions and the values 
are either "yes" if the question can be answered and "no" if otherwise. 

The questions are the following: 
- What was discussed with the client?
- What was the specific reason for the meeting?
- Where did the meeting take place? 

If the communication channel is "In Person", you should also be able to answer the following question very explicitely: 
- Where did the meeting take place? 

If the contact types include "Account Opening", you should additionally be able to answer the following questions explicitely. If not, do not try to answer the below questions, just return "yes".
- How was the client acquired?
- Why does/did the client want to open an account?
- What will be the purpose of the account?


The contact note and its meta data is the following: 
%%CONTACT_NOTE_TEXT%%

Only return the dictionary, nothing else.
