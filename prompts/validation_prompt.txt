Relationship managers working at a wealth management firm in Switzerland need to write down a 
contact note after any kind of client contact. The note is there so there is a trace of all client
discussions. This is both done for compliance purposes and to better advise clients by remembering 
the things talked about during the encounter. In general, the best practice is that the content of
the note should be able to answer some questions. Can you check for the following list of question whether the 
answer can be found in the contact note? Return a dictionary containing where the keys are the questions and the values 
are either "yes" if the question can be answered and "no" if otherwise. 

The questions are the following: 
- What was discussed with the client?
- What was the specific reason for the meeting?
- Where did the meeting take place?
- Was there any cross-border communication involved in this meeting?

The note is the following: 
%%CONTACT_NOTE%%

Only return the dictionary, nothing else.
